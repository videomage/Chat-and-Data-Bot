# Chat-and-Data-Bot
ALL FILES MUST BE ADDED TO THE SAME DIRECTORY FOR THE BOT TO FUNCTION
Framework for a chatbot with the ability to learn, store, and recall information about the user. Written in Python.
The default user password is stored in the User_Password.txt file, however this can be changed within the program.
You will be required to change your password on your initial load of the program.
The password is put into place to give the user the option to add more sensitive information to the program database, which is stored locally. However it is still reccomended to be cautious about the information added to the database.
The chat feature of the bot is currently very basic and does not possess many responses. At the date of writing this (4/3/2022) the bot is able to respond to basic greetings and questions pertaining mood (e.g. "how are you?"). The bot is also able to recall and "remember" information taught to it when asked.
